This is a repository I commit all of my C# scripts written as part of a course to.
While a lot of them are very simple, I hope anyone who comes accross them could better understand my learning journey.
I already have some experience with C# from my time with Unity, but I hope that this course will help me revise the basics and master the more advanced topics, as well as improve my capacities as a programmer/game dev
