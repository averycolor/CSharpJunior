This is a repository I commit all of my C# scripts written as part of a course to.
While a lot of them are very simple, I hope anyone who comes accross them could better understand my learning journey.
I already have some experience with C# from my time with Unity, but I hope that this course will help me revise the basics and master the more advanced topics, as well as improve my capacities as a programmer/game dev

! NB ! - Some/all of the scripts were written in a newer version of Visual Studio (2022+), so they may not contain your expected namespace/class/void main hierarchy which is typically present when creating a CLI Application using the preset in older versions of VS
